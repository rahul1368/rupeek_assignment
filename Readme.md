// Steps to start the project
//After extracting the project please go to rupeek directory.

1.Then run command npm install , it will install the required modules.
2. Then type command node index.js , then this will provide the output for Problem 1.
3.To check the output of Problem 2 , first in terminal type node index.js and then in browser open index.html.

Note: In index.html , kindly put your Google Maps API key.
Also in index.js i have taken a small amount of xml data input, you can easily input more data.

Problem 3 solution is being coded using C++.
I have also attached the output file.

If You have any query then feel free to ask.

Thanks and Regards
